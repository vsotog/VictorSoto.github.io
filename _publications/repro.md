The Edge computing paradigm, as an extension of the Cloud, is intended to reduce the delay of applications involving data analysis by processing raw information near the source and alleviating the load of the cloud server. Edge computing allied to Vehicular Clouds, as well as Vehicular Networks, is a powerful technique that conciliates the new of processing power with the underused resources capacity, but this brings both advantages and challenges. The primary challenge in this environment consists of the mobility of vehicles, followed by intermittent connectivity. This paper thus proposes a data retrieval protocol to efficiently retrieve the results of the offloaded task by using both vehicles and roadside units as communication entities. Three retrieval protocols are considered: a topology-based protocol that uses the network topology to forward the messages, a distance-based forwarding protocol that uses a timer to avoid a broadcasting storm, and the proposed hybrid protocol REPRO, which achieves enhanced performance and low delay retrieval with in presence of different vehicular densities.
